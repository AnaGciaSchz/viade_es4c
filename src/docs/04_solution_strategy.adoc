== Solution Strategy

Viade is a decentralized route management system based on the Solid specifications.

=== Technollogy decisions

- Use of .geojson as the main format for route representation (more formats will be supported later).
- NodeJs to implement the Solid server
- Using the Solid recommendations and specifications

=== Organizational decisions

All members are unaware of the React technology and SOLID specifications, so it has been decided that all members will study React and Solid on their own. In addition, some members will focus more on information management in PODs and others on access to them.
