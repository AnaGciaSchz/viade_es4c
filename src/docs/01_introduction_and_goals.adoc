== Introduction and Goals

A decentralized web application of routes will be made following the SOLID architecture and the React framework. With it, users will be able to store routes, visualize them on a map and share photos, videos or other types of files with their friends or groups of friends.


=== Requirements Overview

==== Functionals

- Users should be able to view the routes on a map and store them on their own pods.
- By using their own pods, the information will be totally decentralized, favoring data security.
- They will also be able to have friends and groups of friends with whom to share these routes, photos, videos, etc.


==== Non functionals

- The system must be accessible and intuitive for all types of users, although special attention will be focused on favouring those with less experience in applications of this style.
- Avoid compromising user information by decentralizing data on separate pods for each user.
- Follow the recommendations of the W3C to ensure an error-free and safer website.


=== Quality Goals

|===
|Goal|Description
|Accessibility|The application must support and be prepared for all types of users, regardless of their abilities, cognitive problems...
|Availability|The web must be available to its users at all times and, in case of failure, the error must be quickly repaired.
|Security|User data must be protected to prevent third parties from accessing them.
|Testability|Tests must be able to be carried out to check the correct functioning of the system.
|Performance|The system must be effective and react quickly to user requests for action.
|Scalability|The website can be progressively expanded in a simple way as development progresses, either by extending existing features or by adding new ones.
|Consistency|The data storage system must keep the information in a correct state all the time.
|Usability|The application must be intuitive and easy to use by any type of user.
